Kaillera v0.84c (c) 2001 Christophe Thibault
-------------
http://www.kaillera.com/

how to use it:
--------------

run mame32k.exe and select File->Play network game...
also, it'd be somewhat convenient to have some roms in the "roms/" folder :)

infos:
------
modem users will get some lag, although games are playable.

otherwise, if you have a kaillera server nearby (i.e. <100ms ping), this should work like a charm.

hints:
------

- analog input is NOT supported yet. so supersprint, etc... WON'T work.
- exit the game by pressing the ESC key, not by closing the window. I don't know why, but
  it seems to have a better behaviour for keeping your connection active or something.
- some people reported that upgrading to the latest Internet Explorer version fixed some of 
  their problems (creating new game, joining games, ...)
- use the 'T' key while in game for text chat. use 'ESC' to cancel.

thanks to:
----------

keops_eqx, ana|ogue, leviathan, smame, and all others for their support...
